### Things to do:

- Create a configuration system to quickly change settings like current active model (look into MongoDB)
- Create an proper API server for the TTS
- Send transcribed text to gpt-3.5 so it can get rid of any imperfections of the detection, provided this solution is fast enough to not disturb the user
